Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

Both: The way that the instructions were written allowed us to easily interpret the instructions into our own Interaction pattern. 

Matt: Because there was a lack of strict interaction pattern, it allowed me to be a little looser with my code and feel more creative. I didn't feel like I needed to get a certain return on tests which caused us to approach the problem differently.

If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

Matt: I think going back and making a dynamic ship or dynamic board where the player has more options for ship size and board size would be ideal.

Terry: I would like to address some of the loops and start methods in the game.rb file to try to chunk off some of the loops by adding more ship methods, so on.

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

Both: With the exception of Iteration 1, which we both completed solo, we almost exclusively used drive / navigator pairing methods. This was beneficial as we both knew how we wanted to tackle certain issues and were always on the same page.

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

Directly within our pairing sessions. We established how we wanted and expected feedback to be shared before even starting the project. Part of why we used so many branches in certain areas was so we could breakout into another branch and try someone elses idea and determine if it a. worked and b. we liked it better. Then we could decide whether we wanted to implement it or not.
